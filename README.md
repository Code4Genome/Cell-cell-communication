# ðŸ”¬ Cell-Cell Communication Analysis in Bulk and Single-Cell RNA-seq
Multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that must coordinate their behaviors through communication. Cellâ€“cell communication (CCC) is essential for growth, 
development, differentiation, tissue and organ formation, maintenance, and physiological regulation. 
**Cells communicate through direct contact or at a distance using ligandâ€“receptor interactions.** 
So cellular communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal conduction for generation and intercellular transmission of signals, 
and cell signal transduction for reception and procession of signals.
Several R packages (Cellchat, NicheNET, LIANA, IcellNET, etc.,) and python resources (CellphoneDB, LIANA, etc.,)are available for analyzing and visualizing cell-cell communication (CCC) from bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data. 
These packages help identify potential ligand-receptor interactions, pathways involved, and communication networks.
